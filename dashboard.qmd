# Dashboard Presentation

**Dashboard Design:**  
The dashboard was designed to provide an intuitive and informative overview of accident data, with a focus on temporal patterns, severity distribution, injuries and fatalities, and geographical analysis. The layout is structured around key categories, each containing visual elements that help users quickly grasp accident trends and key insights:

1. **Temporal Patterns**:  
   - A **line plot** of total accidents by month helps users see long-term trends in accident occurrences.
   - A **bar chart** of total accidents by weekday enables users to identify which days have higher accident frequencies.
  
2. **Severity Distribution**:  
   - **Pie charts** segment accidents by severity and by injuries, giving users a clear understanding of how accidents are distributed in these categories.
   - A **Sankey chart** is used to visualize the relationship between accident severity and types of accidents, helping users understand the flow of data between these variables.

3. **Injuries and Fatalities**:  
   - A **vertical bar chart** compares injuries versus fatalities, allowing users to visually assess the severity of incidents.
   - A **Sankey chart** links fatalities to types of accidents, providing insights into which types of accidents are most associated with fatalities.
   - A **box plot** of injuries shows the spread and distribution of injury severity.

4. **Time of Day**:  
   - A **line plot** of total accidents by hour of day shows when accidents are most frequent throughout the day.
   - A second **line plot**, segmented by severity, allows users to see how accident severity varies across different hours.

5. **Geographical Analysis**:  
   - A **heat map** displays accident density by location, helping users identify hotspots where accidents occur most frequently.
   - A **severity map** features color-coded bubbles for each severity type, which are plotted by location, providing a spatial view of accident severity across regions.

6. **Yearly Trends**:  
   - A **bar chart** of total accidents by year gives users a high-level view of how accident occurrences have changed over time.

7. **All Data**:  
   - An **export feature** allows users to download all the raw accident data for further analysis.
   - A **data table** displays the complete dataset, enabling users to access detailed records of all accidents.

These visual elements have been chosen to present accident data in a clear, interactive, and insightful manner, helping users analyze accident trends across various dimensions and explore different aspects of the data.

**Implementation:**  
The dashboard was built using **Google Data Studio**, a tool that seamlessly integrates with **Google BigQuery** for real-time data queries. The processed accident data was stored in BigQuery, and Data Studio was used to create the interactive charts and maps that populate the dashboard. Each visual element (e.g., line plots, bar charts, Sankey charts, maps) is directly linked to BigQuery queries, ensuring that the data presented is always up to date.

**Presentation of Results:**  
The dashboard provides users with a comprehensive view of accident data, including insights into temporal patterns, severity, injuries and fatalities, and geographical distribution. For example, users can explore trends over time with the line and bar charts, or delve into severity-related insights through the pie charts and Sankey charts. The geographical maps allow users to identify accident hotspots and assess the severity of incidents across different locations. 

**User Interaction:**  
The dashboard provides various interactive features to allow users to drill down and explore the data further:  
1. **Filters and Segmentation**: Users can filter data by time (e.g., month, day, hour) or accident severity, and the dashboard updates in real-time to reflect the selected criteria.  
2. **Geographical Interaction**: The heat map and severity map allow users to click on specific regions to get detailed insights into accidents in those areas.  
3. **Data Export**: Users can export the full dataset for offline analysis or further processing.  
4. **Drill-Down Features**: The Sankey charts and time-of-day plots allow users to explore relationships between variables (e.g., severity vs. accident type or accidents by hour), providing deeper insights into the patterns.  

With these features, the dashboard serves as a powerful tool for stakeholders to explore, analyze, and make data-driven decisions regarding accident prevention and safety improvements.
